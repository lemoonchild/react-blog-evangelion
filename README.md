The Evangelion Blog is a fan-made platform to celebrate the rich universe of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series. This web application serves as a hub for fans to explore content, share insights, and relive the iconic moments of the series through a modern, interactive experience. It's built using the power of React, Babel for JSX compilation, and CSS for styling.
